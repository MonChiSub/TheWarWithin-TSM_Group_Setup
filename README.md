# World of Warcraft - Shadowlands TSM4 Groups

TSM4 Group Setup made by MonChSub,

Setup is used by streamer [StudenAlbatroz](https://www.twitch.tv/studenalbatroz), due to popular request, I have published my setup for the whole community to use for free. 

If you have issues while importing, do a "/reload" or "/script ReloadUI();". Check if the group that caused the error was added properly.

If you need a quick video (No sound) of how to import / setup the TSM from scratch, [click here](https://youtu.be/-iwthyf1_o0).
